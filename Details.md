# Structure of the repository

## Round 1 Directory:
- Each question that you have will first have it's serial number and then the question's name:
> For example, 01. Hello_World

- After the folder is created, push the question statement as both a markdown and a text file, your solution in the language that you prefer, and finally the testcases for that particular problem statement once you are done with the test generation part of the problem.

- Then I want you guys to update the markdown called approvals.md and append your question statement in that.

- For reference as to how to draft the problem statement, and in what format it should be, refer to <a href="https://github.com/Roonil03/ProjectEulerCodes/tree/main/Problem0008.%20LargestProductInASeries">this example</a>
> and yes, I want you to tag who made the github question with linking your github... It's good practice.

## Round 3 Directory:
- Similar to the round 1 directory, except here you can push your writeups of the dataset generations, the dataset itself as a `.csv` or similar filetype and finally whether it's approved or not.

## General Rules:

Apart from that, no force pushes. Like stated in the OC meeting, if I see force pushes happening or changes to documents that have been made by us...

> No perm time for you kiddo...

### New Changes Log v1:
- First things first, start maintaining what is the question inspiration in approvals.md, and communicate more with your teammates when making questions. There's 1-2 questions which are overlapping and I think there may be more.
- Also start making questions which are a little easier, because there will be people who won't know how to code, and they will be solving using pen and paper.
- Figure out other sites, like LeetCode's maths problems, or hackereather's maths section for other problems as well. And please start framing the questions that look like [this.](https://github.com/Roonil03/ProjectEulerCodes/blob/main/Problem0137.%20FibonacciGoldenNuggets/README.md)
