# Collatz Sequence (Difficulty: Medium)

The following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive integers:

- **n → n / 2** (if n is even)  
- **n → 3n + 1** (if n is odd)

Using the rule above and starting with 13, we generate the following sequence:

13 → 40 → 20 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1


It can be seen that this sequence (starting at 13 and finishing at 1) contains **10 terms**.  
Although it has not been proved yet (this is known as the *Collatz Problem*), it is thought that all starting numbers eventually finish at 1.

👉 **Task:**  
Find the **starting number under 10,000** that produces the **second longest Collatz chain**.
