### Solution  

Total number of three-digit numbers:  

$$
900
$$  

A number has exactly three factors **iff** it is the **square of a prime number**.  

Squares of **11,13,17,19,23,29,31** are 3 digit numbers.

That gives **7 such numbers**.  

Therefore, the required probability is:  

$$
\frac{7}{900} = 0.00777
$$
