# The Three-Factor Mystery (Difficulty: Easy)

### Problem  
Find the probability that a randomly chosen **three-digit number** has exactly **three factors**.
**Hint** : A number has exactly three factors **iff** it is the **square of a prime number**.  
---

### Solution  

Total number of three-digit numbers:  

$$
900
$$  

A number has exactly three factors **iff** it is the **square of a prime number**.  

Squares of primes that are three-digit numbers are:  

$$
11^2, \, 13^2, \, 17^2, \, 19^2, \, 23^2, \, 29^2, \, 31^2
$$  

That gives **7 such numbers**.  

Therefore, the required probability is:  

$$
\frac{7}{900}
$$
