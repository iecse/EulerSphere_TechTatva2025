# The Bouncing Ball (Difficulty: Easy)

### Problem  

A ball is dropped from the height of **120 metres**. After striking a floor, the ball rebounds **4/5** of the height from which it was dropped.  
Then find the **total distance** that it travels before coming to rest.

---

### Solution  

Initially the ball falls from a height of 120 metres.  

After striking the floor, it rebounds and rises to a height of  

$$
\frac{4}{5} \times 120
$$  

metres.  

Now, it falls from a height of  

$$
\frac{4}{5} \times 120
$$  

metres and after rebounding rises to a height of  

$$
\frac{4}{5} \times \frac{4}{5} \times 120
$$  

metres.  

This process is continued till the ball comes to rest.

### Total distance travelled  

$$
= 120 + 2 \left[ \frac{4}{5} \times 120 + \left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^2 \times 120 + \ldots \right]
$$  

$$
= 120 + 2 \left[ \frac{\frac{4}{5} \times 120}{1 - \frac{4}{5}} \right]
$$  

$$
= 1080 \ \text{metres}
$$
