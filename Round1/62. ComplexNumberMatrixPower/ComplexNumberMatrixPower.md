## Problem 1: Complex Number Matrix Power

### Problem Statement

Consider the matrix with complex entries:

$$
A = \begin{pmatrix}
1+i & 2 \\
-i & 1-i
\end{pmatrix}
$$

Find the real part of the trace of $A^{10}$.

### Notes

- Work with complex arithmetic throughout
- Use matrix exponentiation for $A^{10}$
- Extract the real part of tr($A^{10}$) = Re($A^{10}_{11} + A^{10}_{22}$)
- Submit the exact integer value
