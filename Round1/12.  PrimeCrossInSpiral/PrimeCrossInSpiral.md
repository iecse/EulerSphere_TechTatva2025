# Prime Cross in Spiral

## Description
# Prime Cross in Spiral

## Description

Starting from **1** at the center of a square spiral and moving **anticlockwise**, we form layers of increasing **odd side length**.

### Example: Spiral with Side Length 5

| 21 | 22 | 23 | 24 | 25 |
|----|----|----|----|----|
| 20 |  7 |  8 |  9 | 10 |
| 19 |  6 |  1 |  2 | 11 |
| 18 |  5 |  4 |  3 | 12 |
| 17 | 16 | 15 | 14 | 13 |

Numbers along the diagonals:

21, 7, 1, 3, 13, 17, 5, 1, 9, 25.  


Primes on diagonals:
 7, 3, 13, 17, 5

---

## Task

 Continue building larger and larger spirals (always with odd side lengths: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, â€¦). Find the first side length of the spiral for which the ratio of primes on both diagonals falls below 20%.



---

## Input

No input required.

---

## Output

A single integer:  
The **side length** of the square spiral where the prime ratio first drops below **20%**.

---

## Constraints

- Only **odd side lengths** are allowed.  
- The center number \(1\) is **not considered prime**.

$$
\boxed{309}
