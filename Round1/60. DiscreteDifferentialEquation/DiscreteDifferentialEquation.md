## Discrete Differential Equation

### Problem Statement

Consider the discrete difference equation:
$$y_{n+1} - 2y_n + y_{n-1} = 3^n$$

with initial conditions $y_0 = 1$ and $y_1 = 4$.

Find $y_{10}$.

### Notes

- This is a second-order linear non-homogeneous difference equation
- Solve the homogeneous part: $y_{n+1} - 2y_n + y_{n-1} = 0$
- Find particular solution for the non-homogeneous term $3^n$
- Apply initial conditions to determine constants
