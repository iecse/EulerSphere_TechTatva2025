## Square Free 
A number is called square free if none of its factors contain a perfect square 
Simply put , it should not be divisible by a perfect square.

    e.g 12 = 2^2 * 3 
        36 = 3^2 * 2^2
  
Hence these are not square free numbers.

     35 = 7 * 5 is a square free number 

Now Find the total square free numbers below 1000000.
