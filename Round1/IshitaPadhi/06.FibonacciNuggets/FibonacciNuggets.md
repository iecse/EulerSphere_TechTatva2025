# Prime Cross in Spiral

## Description

Starting from the number **1** at the center of a square spiral and moving **anticlockwise**, we form layers of increasing side length.

For example, a spiral with side length \( 5 \) looks like this:

| 21 | 22 | 23 | 24 | 25 |
|----|----|----|----|----|
| 20 |  7 |  8 |  9 | 10 |
| 19 |  6 |  1 |  2 | 11 |
| 18 |  5 |  4 |  3 | 12 |
| 17 | 16 | 15 | 14 | 13 |

---

## Diagonal Numbers

The numbers along both diagonals are:

\[
21, \ 7, \ 1, \ 3, \ 13, \ 17, \ 5, \ 9, \ 25
\]

Among these, the prime numbers are:

\[
7, \ 3, \ 13, \ 17, \ 5
\]

Thatâ€™s **5 primes out of 9 diagonal numbers**, giving a ratio of approximately:

\[
\frac{5}{9} \approx 55.5\%
\]

---

## Task

Continue building larger and larger spirals (always with odd side lengths: \(1, 3, 5, 7, 9, \dots \)).

Find the **first side length** of the spiral for which the ratio of primes on both diagonals falls below **20%**.

---

## Input

- **No input required.**

---

## Output

A single integer:

- The **side length** of the square spiral where the prime ratio first drops below \(20\%\).

---

## Constraints

- The spiral is built only with **odd side lengths**.
- The center number \(1\) is **not considered prime**.

---

## Solution

\[
\boxed{309}
\]
