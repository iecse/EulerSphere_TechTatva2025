**DESCRIPTION:**

 Prime Generating Cubic

Mathematicians are fascinated by quadratic and cubic polynomials that generate large sequences of prime numbers.

For example, the polynomial
f(n) = n² + n + 41
produces 40 consecutive primes for n = 0 to 39.

We will now explore cubic polynomials of the form:
f(n) = n³ + a·n + b
where a and b are integers.

A polynomial is said to be prime-rich if it produces the maximum number of consecutive primes starting from n = 0.

Task
Find integers a and b that make the cubic polynomial produce the longest run of consecutive prime numbers starting from n = 0. Output the product a·b of these coefficients.

Input
No input required.

Output
A single integer, the product of the coefficients a and b.

Constraints

|a| < 50

|b| ≤ 50
